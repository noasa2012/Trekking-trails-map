# Trekking Trails Map

An interactive web application that displays hiking trails from around the world on a map. Built using **Leaflet.js** and **OpenStreetMap**, this project allows users to explore trails with detailed information such as difficulty level, altitude, location, and duration.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Map:** Displays global hiking trails with markers color-coded by difficulty (Easy, Moderate, Hard).
- **Search & Filters:** Refine trails by difficulty, location, altitude range, and duration.
- **Dynamic Data:** Trail information is fetched from Google Sheets via a Node.js backend.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Responsive design for seamless interaction.

## How It Works
1. The map is powered by **Leaflet.js** and styled using **OpenStreetMap** tiles.
2. Trail data is stored in Google Sheets and accessed through the Sheets API.
3. Filters allow users to customize their trail search based on personal preferences.
4. Markers on the map display detailed information about each trail in a popup.

## Usage
Simply open the `index.html` file in a browser to view and interact with the map. Trails are displayed dynamically, and filters can be applied to enhance the user experience.
